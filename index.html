  <p class="muted">Freshman at the University of Pennsylvania | Philadelphia, PA </p>

  <h2 id="about">Background</h2>

<div class="card">
  <p>
    I am a student with interests in economics, data analysis, and public policy.
    My work focuses on understanding how social and economic systems shape real-world outcomes,
    especially in areas related to inequality, education, and public health.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through coursework and independent projects, I have developed experience working with data,
    research writing, and analytical tools. I am particularly interested in using quantitative
    analysis to support policy decisions and social impact initiatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of academics, I enjoy learning new technical skills, exploring interdisciplinary
    research, and building projects that connect theory with practical applications.
